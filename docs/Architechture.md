## 1. Introduction
With an overwhelming amount of content available, learners struggle to create a structured and effective learning path. This project aims to build a **Dynamic Learning Management System (LMS)** powered by **LLMs** that adapts to user behavior and learning styles, offering personalized course roadmaps and tracking progress using memory management.

The system will feature two learning modes:
- **Structured Mode (Predefined Learning Path):** A traditional course roadmap.
- **Adaptive Mode (AI-Powered Learning Path):** Dynamically generated learning content based on user progress and understanding.

## 2. Market Analysis
### Existing LMS Solutions and Challenges
| Tool | Market Share | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| Coursera | High | High-quality courses, certificates | Expensive, rigid structure |
| Udemy | High | Affordable, large course variety | No personalized learning |
| Khan Academy | Medium | Free, structured | Lacks adaptive learning |
| EdX | Medium | University-level courses | Limited personalization |

### How We Stand Out
- **Personalized AI-Driven Learning Paths** âœ¨
- **Real-time Progress Tracking & Adaptation** ðŸ”„
- **Memory-Based Learning for Tailored Content** ðŸ§ 

---

## 3. Project Overview
The LMS will:
1. Accept user input on what they want to learn.
2. Generate structured learning content using **LLMs (LLaMA, ChatGPT, etc.)**.
3. Track user progress and provide tailored next steps.
4. Offer an **adaptive learning experience** with real-time content adjustments.

---

## 4. System Features
1. **AI-Powered Course Generation** â€“ Automatically creates courses based on the userâ€™s request.
2. **Structured & Adaptive Learning Modes** â€“ Users can select between a predefined roadmap or an AI-driven dynamic experience.
3. **User Progress Tracking** â€“ Tracks completed sections, progress, and user behavior.
4. **Memory-Based Adaptation** â€“ Uses long-term tracking to optimize content recommendations.
5. **User Feedback Integration** â€“ Learners can revise, move forward, or summarize content based on their understanding.

---

## 5. User Flow
### **1. Home Page**
- Simple navbar + input box + footer.
- User enters a query (e.g., "I want to learn Python").
- Query is sent to the backend.

### **2. Course Generation**
- Backend interacts with a global **LLM Model (GM)** to refine the prompt.
- A **User-Specific Model (UM)** is created to generate a personalized learning path.
- Loader messages: "Generating your personalized content..."
- After completion, user is redirected to the **Dashboard**.

### **3. Dashboard**
- User sees the generated course.
- Two options: **Structured Mode** & **Adaptive Mode**.

### **4. Learning Modes**
#### **Structured Mode**
- Predefined roadmap with sections.
- User selects a section and studies the generated content.

#### **Adaptive Mode**
- Initially shows one section.
- After completion, asks questions to assess understanding.
- Offers options: **Revise**, **Move Forward**, **Summarize**.

## 6. Detailed Architecture
### **Architecture Diagram**

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with REST APIs
- **Database:** MongoDB (Stores user progress and content)
- **LLM Processing:** ChatGPT / LLaMA
- **Memory Module:** Tracks user-specific learning paths
